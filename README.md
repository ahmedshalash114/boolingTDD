# boolingTDD

This is the rule of TDD Task that we will work together on it ..

Booling is very popular game with some rules 

1:- Booling have 10 Frames .

2:- You are allowed to play twice in the frame since you did not hit the full pins per frame from the first time which is 10 .

3:- Maximum Score you can get is 300 which is called perfect game and you will allowed 

4:- In You Turn if you hit the 10 pins in twice this is called spare the calculation will be your score plus the first score from the next frame 

For Example you hit 7 then 3 this is spare then you hit 6 pins and 3  in the next frame then the calculation will be 7+3+6 = 16 plus 6+3 which is the next frame score .. 

Frame 1, ball 1: 7 pins 
Frame 1, ball 2: 3 pins. (spare)
Frame 2, ball 1: 6 pins
Frame 2, ball 2: 3 pins

The total score from these throws is:
Frame one: 10 + (6) = 16
Frame two: 6 + 3 = 9
TOTAL = 25



5:- Strike is hiting the 10 pins from the first time and the calculation is your score plus the score of next two frames for Example

Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins
Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins

The total score from these throws is:
Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19
Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9
TOTAL = 28

6:- Perfect Game is when you are keeping get strike you will get another frame to be 11 if you did it again you will get another one to be 12 and you will hit the maxium score .. 


This will be writting it TDD but you can start by writing the easy parts like normal game , then spare one , then strike one
